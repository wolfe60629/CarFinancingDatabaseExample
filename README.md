# Car Financing Database Example

This project was used as my final project for a databases class held at the university. The goal of my project was to mimic a lighter version of a car financing database. Functionalities of the project include procedures to add and sell vehicles from a dealer, calculate payments based on customizable intrest rates, record a transactional history for all dealers, record a transactional history for all payments made by a customer, and store user information securely within the database. 

## Getting Started

Written in Microsoft SQL, this project requires a schema called jawolf7279. This schema can be changed, but it will have to be changed throughout the entirety of the project. Included in the project is a sql file to create the tables needed to get started. There are also a few procedures needed that are included in the project.

## Built With

```
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
```
