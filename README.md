# Car Financing Database Example

This project was used as my final project for a databases class held at the university. The goal of this project was to create a small scale version of a car manufacturer's financial database. Functionalities of the project include: procedures to add and sell vehicles from a dealer, calculate payments based on customizable intrest rates, record transactional history for all dealers, record transactional history for all payments made by a customer, and store user information securely within the database. 

## Getting Started

This project requires a schema of jawolf7279. This schema can be changed, but will have to be changed throughout the entirety of the project. Included in the project is a sql file to create the tables that are needed to get started. There are also a few procedures included in the project that will need to be added to the database before adding inventory.

## Built With

```
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
